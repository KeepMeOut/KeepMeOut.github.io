This allows the app to prevent uninstallation during active lock periods."},{id:"lock-duration",question:"How long can I lock my phone for?",answer:"You can set lock durations from minutes to hours, depending on your focus needs. The app is flexible to accommodate both short study sessions and longer work periods."},{id:"emergency-contact-setup",question:"How do I set up emergency contacts?",answer:"You can add important contacts to your emergency contacts list in the app settings.

Please be aware that due to the amount of mail we get, a reply may take some time.")},{id:"receiving-calls",question:'Can I still receive calls when my phone is in "lock mode"?',answer:"Yes, since the issue of an emergency could arise outside of your influence, we feel this is important.

Doze mode is a power-saving feature that restricts certain activities when the device is idle, which includes scheduled lock activities."},{id:"doze-mode-effects",question:"What happens during Doze mode that affects the scheduled lock feature?",answer:"During Doze mode, the device limits access to resources to conserve battery life. As a result, scheduled tasks, such as the lock feature in the KMO app, may not be triggered until the user interacts with the device by moving, unlocking, or glancing at the lock screen."},{id:"doze-mode-workaround",question:"How can I ensure that the scheduled lock works even when the device is in Doze mode?",answer:"If you find that the scheduled lock is not activating as expected, try unlocking or looking at the lock screen. This interaction with the device will prompt the system to exit Doze mode, allowing the scheduled lock feature to be activated and function as intended."},{id:"lock-screen-necessity",question:"Why is a lock screen necessary for the proper functioning of the scheduled lock feature?",answer:"The lock screen serves as a secure barrier to protect your device and its features. For the scheduled lock feature to work effectively, it relies on the lock screen to display notifications and activate the lock. Without a lock screen, the scheduled lock feature may not operate as intended."},{id:"lock-screen-setup",question:"Do I need to have a lock screen set up on my phone for the scheduled lock feature to work properly?",answer:"Yes, it is recommended to have a pin, pattern, or another form of lock screen security set up on your device for the scheduled lock feature to work seamlessly. Having a lock screen ensures that notifications are displayed correctly and allows the lock to function as intended."},{id:"optimal-lock-screen",question:"What type of lock screen should I set up for optimal performance?",answer:"You can choose any secure lock screen option available on your device, such as a pin, pattern, password, or biometric authentication (fingerprint or facial recognition). The key is to have a form of security that ensures device privacy while allowing the scheduled lock feature to work seamlessly."},{id:"app-without-lock-screen",question:"Can I still use the KMO app without setting up a lock screen on my device?",answer:"While the KMO app may still function without a lock screen, it is highly recommended to set up a lock screen for an optimal experience.
